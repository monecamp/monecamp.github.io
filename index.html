            <h3>What is MoneCamp?</h3>
            <p>MoneCamp is a new Monetate event to promote knowledge sharing, discussion, and collaboration among Monetators. It consists of presentations, panels, and discussions on any topic (work related or not) and is open to everyone. You could present on a tool you love to use at work, have a discussion about a new product idea, talk about your favorite hobby, or have a group meditation session outside!</p>

            <h3>Format</h3>
            <p>As with other unconferences like Barcamp, all of the content is produced by the event attendees themselves. Presenters sign up ahead of time and then people vote on what they are most interested in seeing. Once voting ends, a schedule is drawn up and posted and on the day of the event you attend those events that most interest you.</p>
